Coding agents are strong, but they live in a terminal window with no memory of last week, no view of your other projects and no way to see what ten of them are doing at once. **Operant is a desktop app that hosts Claude Code and OpenCode per project and keeps what they learn.** It does not orchestrate work for you: each agent is the real CLI, running with your account, in your folder.

## Quick start

Download the installer for your system from [Releases](https://github.com/doolecg/Operant/releases): `.msi` for Windows, `.dmg` for macOS (Apple silicon or Intel), `.AppImage` or `.deb` for Linux. Operant then updates itself.

You need [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) (`claude`) or OpenCode (`opencode`) on your `PATH`.

Read [What Operant runs on your machine](#what-operant-runs-on-your-machine) before the first start, then add a project folder and press New thread.

## Why Operant

**Your agents remember.** When a session ends, Operant extracts the few lessons worth keeping: how the project does things, what failed and why, what you corrected. Useful procedures become skills you approve once, for every session. Memory is one fact per entry, de-duplicated, and stale entries are retired.

**See everything at once.** Threads per project in the sidebar, a Board of every thread across projects with who needs you, and Tiles to watch several agents side by side. Each thread shows its model, context use and state.

**Shells and a browser where you expect them.** Shells open in a drawer at the bottom, like the Console, and only show the current project's. The browser opens at the side of the thread. An AI agent can drive it when you allow it.

**One orchestrator, no fixed team.** Orchestrator Mode lets the thread you are talking to do the work itself and hand a part to a helper only when that saves context or time. No roles to configure, no coordination overhead.

**Built to be cheap on tokens.** Helpers start with only the tools they need and skip your global plugins and hooks, so they begin near 13k tokens instead of over 100k. A Compact button appears when the context is nearly full.

**Private by default.** No account, no analytics, no tracking. Your projects, chats, lessons and settings stay in Operant's data folder. The [privacy section](#privacy-what-leaves-your-computer) lists every connection Operant makes.

## Features

- **Threads, Chat and Terminal views.** Claude Code and OpenCode per project, in a Chat view or the real terminal, with model, effort and context on each.
- **Board and Plans.** The Board shows the threads of all your projects as cards. Plans lists the Engineering tasks of every project.
- **Engineering Mode.** A task goes through frame, spec, slices, plan approval, build and ship, with one approval gate: the plan.
- **Memory that sticks.** Lessons go to the project's Hindsight bank or memory folder. Facts about you are kept apart from facts about the project.
- **Mods.** An Agents panel for sub-agents, a Commands menu, and an activity box for learning and memory.
- **Usage at a glance.** Plan rings for the 5-hour and weekly limits (opt in), budgets and export.
- **Git, backups, presets and themes**, with settings applied live.
- **Edit from here.** Rewind a chat, and optionally the files, to before a message.
- **Dictation.** Speech turned into text on your computer.

## What Operant runs on your machine

Read this before the first start. By using Operant you agree to it running the following.

- **PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` (Windows only).** Operant starts PowerShell for its own bundled scripts with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`: the media controls helper (`media-helper.ps1`, running in the background while Operant is open) and the updater (which asks for admin rights through a Windows UAC prompt before it installs a new version). The bypass applies only to that one PowerShell process. Operant does not change your machine's execution policy and does not run scripts other than its own this way.
- **Installs of optional tools, only when you ask.** On the first start a setup window offers optional tools (OpenCode, uv, CodeGraph, Playwright's Chromium and more). Nothing is ticked and nothing runs until you choose. Each install runs a normal package manager command such as `npm i -g @opencode/cli`, `winget install --id astral-sh.uv -e` or `npx playwright install chromium`, and Settings, Install shows the exact command before it runs. These install system-wide or for your user account, outside Operant's folder.
- **Cookie import, only when you ask.** Settings, Browser can read your default browser's cookies through PowerShell after you confirm.

If you do not want any of this, do not install Operant, or skip the setup window and leave Settings, Install alone. Without the optional tools the features that need them stay hidden and the console shows `ENOENT` lines for the missing commands; that is expected.

## Privacy: what leaves your computer

Operant has no analytics, tracking or crash reporting, and no account of its own. Your projects, chats, lessons and settings stay in Operant's data folder on your computer. These are the only connections Operant makes, and why:

- **Updates.** At start and every few hours Operant asks GitHub (`api.github.com`) for the latest release and downloads the installer from there. GitHub sees your IP address and that you run Operant.
- **Claude Code, OpenCode and other AI tools.** They send your prompts and the files they read to their own services, under your account and their terms. Operant does not see or control that traffic.
- **Claude plan limits (off by default).** If you turn this on in Settings, Tokens and budgets, Operant sends the login token that Claude Code keeps on your computer to Anthropic (`api.anthropic.com`) every few minutes to read your 5-hour and weekly limits. Anthropic's terms may not allow other apps to use that login. Leave it off if you are not sure.
- **z.ai plan limits.** Only if you have set a z.ai key for Claude Code, Operant asks z.ai for your plan usage with that key.
- **Memory (Hindsight).** By default it runs on your computer. If you point it at a LAN or remote server in Settings, the lessons Operant saves go to that server.
- **Dictation.** Installing dictation downloads a speech model from Hugging Face (`huggingface.co`). Speech is turned into text on your computer.
- **Browser tile.** It loads the sites you open. Its default search is DuckDuckGo. If you turn on AI control, an AI agent can drive that browser; Operant opens a debugging port on `127.0.0.1` (your own computer only) for this.
- **Tools you install.** Optional installs (OpenCode, uv, CodeGraph, Playwright's Chromium and more) download from npm, winget, PyPI and the tools' own sites when you choose to install them.

## Development

Needs Node.js 24.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # app with the Vite dev server
npm test           # unit tests
npm run dist       # installers for this system into dist/
```

Optional settings go in a `.env` (copy `.env.example`).
